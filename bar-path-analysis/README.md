This is a project to track the path of a barbell during a lift to analyse technique and performance. For now I took a model from RoboFlow, but my intention is to train a model on my own. I tried Training a YOLO v9 model on my computer but it would take too long.</b>
Next I tried to use EC2 instance on AWS but free version was too limited. Next I tried Google Collab but it was limited as well </b>
Next steps involves training a nn on keras framework or installing Linux and using ROCm, pytorch supports gpu processing for nn training, that will let me leverage my GPU.  </b>
